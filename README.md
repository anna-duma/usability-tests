# **Usability Tests**

## Introduction
Usability tests are very important for validating the usefulness of your documentation or product. A document should be clear, concise, and logical in order to be helpful to users. The usability test samples are reports written following a usability test where a participant completed the steps within the document.

## Usage
Use the documentation to guide a participant through the tasks in the document. Determine and report on if the goal of the document has been met and the tasks were completed successfully.

## Future Applications
A usability test can reveal confusing instructions or unclear information that may hinder a participant's ability to complete a task. It is an effective way to identify where improvements are needed in the documentation for the end-user to be successful.
